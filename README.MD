- Responsive layout
- Hover effects
- Semantic HTML structure
- Well-organized CSS

## üõ† Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox/Grid for layout
- Modern CSS practices

## üìö What I Learned

This project helped reinforce several key web development concepts:

### Centering Techniques

The main challenge was **centering the container div** on the page. I explored and implemented various centering methods:

Each method has its use cases:
- **Flexbox**: Great for layouts with multiple items
- **Grid**: Simplest for single-item centering
- **Absolute positioning**: Works when you need precise control

## üöß Challenges Faced

### Centering the Main Container

**Challenge**: Getting the card to center both horizontally and vertically on the page.

**Problem**: Initially struggled with choosing the right centering technique and ensuring it worked across different viewport sizes.

**Solution**: After testing multiple approaches, I settled on using Flexbox because it:
- Provides consistent results
- Is responsive by default
- Requires minimal code
- Works well across all modern browsers

**Key Takeaway**: Modern CSS layout methods like Flexbox and Grid have largely replaced older centering hacks. Using `display: flex` with `justify-content: center` and `align-items: center` (or `display: grid` with `place-items: center`) is now the standard approach.
